As many things change unexpectedly in my life, I have found comfort in my Saturday morning hikes. By Wednesday, I usually have a thought about where I'd like to go. By Friday evening, I have a plan. I don't give it too much thought. I just let myself be drawn to an area, then I plan a hike. That is my Arbitrary Stupid Goal: a weekly hike, usually early on Saturday morning. Having something to look forward to gives me hope during a challenging period of my life.",
