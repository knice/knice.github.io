I live and work in Santa Cruz, California with my wife and cat. I've been writing and making things on the web since I stopped being a biologist in January of 2004.

I love to take photos with my [phone](http://instagram.com/robknight/ "Rob Knight on Instagram") and  [DLSR](http://www.flickr.com/rknight/ "Rob Knighto on Flickr"), get exercise, and impress (read: *pester*) my wife with the web/computer/nerd things I learn every day.

I currently work in the Communications & Marketing group at UC Santa Cruz, where I help oversee the [campus home page](http://www.ucsc.edu), [campus events calendar](https://events.ucsc.edu) [campus news site](http://news.ucsc.edu), and several other university web properties. Currently, we're feverishly working on a responsive *retrofit* of the campus web sites, set to launch in late-August. 

Thanks for stopping by.
