I live and work in Santa Cruz, California with my wife and two cats. I've been writing, working and generally making signal & noise on the web since I stopped being a biologist in January of 2004.

I also [take](http://instagram.com/robknight/) [photos](http://www.flickr.com/rknight/), get exercise, and impress my wife with useless knowledge of web/computer/Mac geekery.

I currently work in the Communications & Marketing group at UC Santa Cruz. Just so we're clear, anything posted on this website is entirely my own opinion and does not in any way reflect the opinions of my employer.

Thanks for stopping by.
