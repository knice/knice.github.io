Built with the Balzac theme for Jekyll, powered by Github pages. Still a work in progress. Don't hate me because my mark-up isn't beautiful. I'm talking to you, William. :-)

## Basic Setup

1. [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) if you haven't already.
2. Download this bad boy.
3.  Fork the [Balzac repo](http://github.com/coletownsend/balzac-for-jekyll/)
