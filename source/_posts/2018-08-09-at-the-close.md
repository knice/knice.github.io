This morning after a meeting I had a long conversation with a colleague about the death of her father. It's been three months since her dad passed away. We talked about how people tend to stop asking about it after a period of time, but you still have plenty of grieving to do. It can be a lonely, quiet place to find yourself.

This is my story about that place. After the initial shock, and before you feel whole again. 

August 4 marked the first Saturday in 15 months that I didn’t have to sign something, clean something, empty something, fill out something, get a signature guarantee on something, go to the bank about something, buy postage for something, calculate something, donate something, pack something, or move something.

Other than paying 2019 taxes, I am done putting my dad and his estate to rest. I feel like I completely most the work in a way he would have approved of (sorry about those last two trips to the dump, dad). I found loving homes for all his beloved trees. His house of 40 years is in good hands and finally getting long overdue improvements.

My brother and I have never been closer. And we even added a sibling last summer when my sister found us! I’ve learned what a gift it is to have siblings--especially after you lose a parent.

But I cannot close this chapter of my life without acknowledging that I lost touch with some things. Many things. More things than I want to admit. And if I’m being honest, I was losing my grip on some things before my dad died. And if I’m looking very close, I might have never had a grip on some things while my dad was in my life. My relationship with my dad was complicated. I don’t think I realized how complicated until recently. 

I rarely touched my camera last year. I questioned a lot about my life and my decisions. I felt adrift at times. I struggled with anxiety for the first time and re-discovered insomnia (hello again, 3am, how are you?). Most importantly, I lost touch with a vision for what would come *after* all of the grieving and estate management was done.

Having hope for a future after a difficult period in life is how we get through those difficult periods. It’s important to have hope. It’s important to *spread* hope. I know you all know this because I see it reflected in your posts all the time. It feels weird to say this, but for a time last year, hope was difficult to come by. *Spreading hope* was even more difficult. Accepting hope from others was also difficult, and that is something I’m thinking about a lot right now. 

My _do everything until it’s done_ approach to working on my dad’s estate meant I was absent from many other parts of my life. More importantly, my attitude toward the work was sour and negative, and spilled over into everything else. I didn’t stop to take real breaks, check in with loved ones, or take time to be present for those that matter most to me.

It’s easy to say, “I was grieving. How would I know to do all of that?” But the reality is, withdrawal is how I’ve dealt with big setbacks throughout my life. The real insight here is not that I can get overwhelmed by big things in life. We all get overwhelmed by big things in life. The real insight is that *my way* of dealing with big things in life needs to change. Please don’t read this as me needlessly flogging myself. It’s actually a helpful admission. I give myself full permission to feel all the feels. It’s what I do *after that* that needs work. When life gets hard, you *lean in* to family, friends, love, hope--not hide from them until you feel better. Lesson learned.  

As the fog of grieving has lifted, I feel humbled, and changed, and also a growing sense of something that feels like hope. I cannot fix the many mistakes I made over the last 15 months.  Perhaps the scars from this chapter of my life will always be the deepest. Time will tell. From here forward, I will be more present. Most importantly, I feel a need to learn about how I *respond* to adversity, and how my response ripples throughout the world around me. I’ve already sought help to explore that more and learn to lean in during times of adversity.

To everyone who walked any part of this journey with me (and ESPECIALLY those who walked *all of it*, side-by-side, along with me--particularly Kalin), I cannot thank you enough for your patience, guidance, and unconditional love--even when you received very little back from me. Hopefully I will make that up to you as our lives carry on from here.

Yesterday morning I woke up early and went for a long hike to the top of a mountain in Carmel. Then I went to the Oakland A’s game with my brother. My first unplanned Saturday in more than a year had spectacular natural beauty, family, and baseball. It’s nice to have Saturdays again. I will make them count--even if/when adversity shows up again.

Last night I received an email from Ed. here it is:

I stepped back from my desk, and sat on the floor of my apartment in silence for a long minute. I thought I was going to cry. I've learned to let the tears flow when they want to...

Instead, I felt compelled to say something to my dad. So I spoke:

"I did everything I could, dad. I gave you everything I had. I did the very best I could. I'm done now. It's time for me to move on."
