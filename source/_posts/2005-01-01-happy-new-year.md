My new year's resolution is to use my time more efficiently, and not to get distracted in my work. Apparently my resolutions aren't grandiose enough, others are aiming higher.
  
It seems like President _Chicken Little_'s new year's resolution is to **dismantle Social Security**. He's been parading the "crisis" rhetoric around for weeks. There's only one problem. Just like those sneaky weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (You remember [those](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3570845.stm), right?), there isn't a crisis.  
  
You've already heard me make my point against dismantling Social Security, I'm not getting on my soapbox today. I'd like to bring you someone else's word's instead.  
  
If you want to get a better idea of exactly what state the Social Security system is in, I cannot recommend enough these two posts by Josh Marshall. The [first post](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_01_02.php#004327) outlines how the government raids the SS trust fund to cover budget deficits. The [second post](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_01_02.php#004330) talks about the myth Bush has been peddling about a $10 trillion SS shortfall.
  
Both posts are short. Maximum reading time: 3 minutes. It is worth your time to educate yourself.
