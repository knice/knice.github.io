I live and work in Santa Cruz, California. I've built things on the web since I stopped being a biologist in January of 2004.

My interests focus on building tools and designing user experiences that make technology more accessible, approachable, and delightful.

For the past 8 years, I've been on the Communications & Marketing team at UC Santa Cruz, where I manage the [campus home page](http://www.ucsc.edu), [events calendar](https://events.ucsc.edu), [news site](https://news.ucsc.edu), and several other university web properties.

I also love to take photos with my [phone](https://instagram.com/robknight/ "Rob Knight on Instagram") and [other cameras](https://www.flickr.com/rknight/).
