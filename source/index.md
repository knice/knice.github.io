I live and work in Santa Cruz, California with my wife and cat. I've built things on the web since I stopped being a biologist in January of 2004.

I work on the Communications & Marketing team at UC Santa Cruz, where I help oversee the [campus home page](http://www.ucsc.edu), [events calendar](https://events.ucsc.edu), [news site](http://news.ucsc.edu), and several other university web properties.

I love to take photos with my [phone](http://instagram.com/robknight/ "Rob Knight on Instagram") and  [DLSR](http://www.flickr.com/rknight/).
