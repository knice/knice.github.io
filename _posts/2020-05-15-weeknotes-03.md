My last weeknotes post was in February. I’m not sure why I haven’t posted any weeknotes since then. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

- We are already half way through the month of May. Time is wondrous and a beast. At the moment, my perception of time is confusing. A year from now, I hope this will all make some sense. 
- On Friday mornings, I set aside time to read [Austin Kleon’s newsletter](https://austinkleon.com/newsletter/). It always has a refreshing collection of thoughts and links I don’t come across in my normal web surfing. A recent issue was called, “[Not everything will be OK, but some things will](https://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=25a34f10515c4e9393e3da856&id=92e9753408).” That issue and the [article of the same name](https://austinkleon.com/2020/05/06/not-everything-will-be-okay/) continues to inhabit the front of my mind.
- [The Prophecies of Q](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/) about the conspiracy theory Q Anon was the most interesting thing I read this week. Little bits of psychology are scattered throughout, but they come to a fascinating conclusion: when people want to do something that betrays their core beliefs, they will go to amazing lengths to create a reality in which they have no choice but to do *that thing*.  
- Confession: I didn’t actually *read* the article above. I listened to it. There is an embedded audio player [in the article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/). Give it a try. As a regular podcast listener and occasional audiobook listener, I think long form journalism is a natural fit for audio. And the time commitment is reasonable. I usually listen to one or two articles while I make dinner.
- I love when [smart people post advice in list form](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/) to celebrate their birthdays. 
- Two of the best articulations of Trump’s derangement and incompetence come in the form of [this article by David Roth in The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/157546/donald-trump-coronavirus-press-conference) and [Trump’s call to Fox & Friends last Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q2h6KctHQ8&feature=youtu.be&t=585). If you only click one of those links, it has to be the second one. Listen to the man talk and tell me he isn’t broken.
