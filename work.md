## UC Santa Cruz

**April 2008–present**. In my time at UCSC, I've led or worked on several redesign/UX projects, including the 2010 redesign of of the campus home page (HTML/CSS; and CMS implementation); the 2013 rebuild of the campus events calendar (Drupal theme development), and the 2014 responsive reboot of the campus CMS templates (code and implementation).

### Director of Digital Communications, _Sept 2016–present_

- Led project to redesign the campus web presence with a design system. 
- Led a transition to JAMstack tools for marketing initiatives and promotion of campus events. 
- Guided the creation of technical solutions and reviewed code for science.ucsc.edu, a redesign of the web presence for the Division of Physical & Biological Sciences.

### Senior Web Developer, _April 2008 – Sept 2016_

- Built a basic domain relay tool in Ruby (Sinatra) on Heroku to redirect old `xxx.ucsc.edu` domains to new sites. The tool collects usage data so we can make informed decisions about how long to keep retired domains.
- Built a Ruby on Rails application to send campus newsletters from campus Google accounts. 
- Built a campus events calendar in Drupal 7. Took feedback from users and made incremental updates to the system. Launched the new calendar on Pantheon hosting and ran without downtime from August 2013 – September 2018.
- Implemented HTML, CSS, and Javascript from a design agency into Cascade Server.
